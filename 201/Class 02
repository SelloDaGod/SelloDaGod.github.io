# Basics of HTML, CSS & JS
* Its is importanrt to use semantic elements because they define sections in a document and different parts of a web page.
* There are 6 levels of headings in HTML.
* You can use terms <sup> and <sub> to mark up dates, chemical formulae, and mathematical equations.
* When using the <abbr> element, you have to provide a full expansion of the word in full text as the value of Title.
Learning CSS-
*Different ways we can apply CSS to our HTML pages are with an external stylesheet, an internal stylesheet, and with inline styles.
* We should avoid using inline styles because it is the least efficient for maintenance and one styling change might require multiple edits.

For the block code displayed 
* h2 represents the selector
* Color and Pading represent the properties 
* Black and 5px are the declarations

Learning JS
* Strings are the datatype for sequence of text
* The 4 types of Js operators are assignment, strict equality, Not/does not equal, and addition
* A real world problem that can be solved with a function is calculating travel time
* An if statement checks condition and if it evaluates to false, then the code block will execute.
* The use of an else if statement is to specify a new condition if the first condition is false.
*The 3 types of comparison operators are the <(less than or equal), <(less than), and >=(greater than or equal)
* The difference is applied to boolean values  the && operator only returns true when both of its operands are true, ( and false in all other cases)
