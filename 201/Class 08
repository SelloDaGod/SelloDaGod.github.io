##CSS Flexbox

1. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional content. This means

2.The difference between main axis and cross axis.

The main axis is the one set by your flex-direction property.
If that is row your main axis is along the row, 
if it is column your main axis is along the column.

The cross axis runs in the other direction to the main axis.
You can move things individually or as a group, so they align against each other.

3. When using row reverse and column reverse reorder happens only for visual order and not logical order.
The logical order is the order that  the screen reader reads out.
If it is out of logical order then the screen reader will be wrong.

##CSS Layout

1. With Flexbox you can vertically center a block of content inside it's parent easily.
You can make all the children of a container take up an equal amount of width/height.

2. This topc connects with my long term goals because in order to code more efficiently,
I may need to use flexbox in future projects.

## Thing I want to know more about.
I want to know more about how these things are used to develop video games.
I also want to know more about how these languages came about.
