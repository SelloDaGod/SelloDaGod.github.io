#CSS
What is meant by “normal flow”?

How webpage elements lay themselves out by default.

What are a few differences between block-level and inline elements?

By default, a block level element's content fills the available inline space of the parent element containing it and the element grows along the block dimension to accommodate its content. 
The size of inline elements is just the size of their content.

Static positioning is the default for every html element.

Name a few advantages to using absolute positioning on an element.

An absolutely positioned element no longer exists in the normal document flow. Instead, it sits on its own layer separate from everything else. 
This is very useful: it means that we can create isolated UI features that don't interfere with the layout of other elements on the page.

What is a key difference between fixed positioning and absolute positioning?

Fixed positioning usually fixes an element in place relative to the visible portion of the viewport.
The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created for the element in the page layout. 
It is positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor, if any; otherwise, it is placed relative to the initial containing block. 
Its final position is determined by the values of top, right, bottom, and left.

#JS
Describe the difference between a function declaration and a function invocation.

The difference is semantic and subtle. When you call a function, you are directly telling it to run. When you invoke a function, you are letting something run it.

What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

A parameter is a variable in a method definition. When a method is called, the arguments are the data you pass into the method's parameters.
