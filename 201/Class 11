## Audio,Video,Images

This topic matters because audio, video, and images are needed to make a  good webpage and knowing how to implement them can be complicated.

1.The ability to use video and audio has evolved from having to use plugins called FLASH and SILVERLIGHT. They both had issues with accessibility and security.
They are now obsolete in favor of the HTML elements <video> and <audio>.

2.For SRC source in the <video> elememt contains a path to the video you want to use. It works in the same way as <img>.
The controls attribute is for the user to be able to control the media in your web page.

3. It is important to have fallback content inside the <video> element because some people use older browsers that don't allow the user to play the video from there.
The fallback content can be a link or text so that the user can still access that media regardless of the browser they use.

4. <video> and <audio> becaome best friends when they met in school one day. All the other classmate are very different from them.
<video> was always to themselves because everybody else has different requirements to function. <audio> was a new student and is exactly like <video>.
The only difference between the two is the media type. They both require fallback content and they both allow the user control the media.

#Grid 

1. Grid difference from flexbox and css grid is that grid is designed to solve layout problems and flexbox's one directional flow has different use cases.

2. A Grid Container is the element where grid is applied. It's the direct parent of all the grid items.
A Grid Lines are lines that make up the structure of the grid whether its horizontal or vertical.

# Responsive Images

1. Developers should make images responsive because a large image size on certain devices csn use up a lot of bandwidth. 
Also on a smaller device things become more difficult to see because things are still sized to fit a desktop screen.

2. <SRCSET> and <SIZES> help provide aditional source images and hints to help the browser pick the right one. <SRCSET> defines the set of images we will allow the 
browser to choose from. each each set of image information is seperated by a comma.
<SIZES> defines a set of media conditions like screen widths. it indicates what image size would be best to use.

3. <SRCSET> is more helpful to use for responsive images than CSS of Javascript because it allows your browser to choose the best image size for a screen.
Using javascript and CSS only allows you to choose from one image source at a time while with <srcset> you can have multiple.
