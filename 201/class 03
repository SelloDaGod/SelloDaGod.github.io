## HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model
HTML
* You use an unoerdered list in your HTML when you are grouping a collection of items that do not have a numerical ordering or the order is meaningless.
* You use the Boolean attribute to set the bullet syle for a list.
* You can change the numbers on list items in multiple ways but two ways are putting I for roman numeral lists or starting with 1 for a regular numbered list.
CSS
* Padding and Margins determine whether elements are pushed away from the box or not.
* Four parts of a HTML elements box-
Content box: The area where your content is displayed; size it using properties like inline-size and block-size or width and height.
Padding box: The padding sits around the content as white space; size it using padding and related properties.
Border box: The border box wraps the content and any padding; size it using border and related properties.
Margin box: The margin is the outermost layer, wrapping the content, padding, and border as whitespace between this box and other elements; 
size it using margin and related properties.

JS
* We can store strings, numbers, objects, and other arrays inside an array.
* The People array is valid and to find the value you can use Value()function.
Operators
* Assignment Operators
* Comparison operators
* Arithmetic operators
* Bitwise operators
* Logical operators
 A loop can be useful in Javascript when you need the user to get an answer correct before they can move on.
