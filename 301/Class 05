# Putting it all Together
1. The single responsibility principle is that a component should ideally only do one thing.
If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents.

2.To build a static version of your application is to build a version that renders the UI from your data model without adding any interactivity.

3.Once you have a static version, you need to add interactivity to enable user actions and dynamic updates.

4.The three questions to determine if something is state: Does it remain unchanged? Is it passed via props? Can it be computed from existing state or props?

5.To identify where state needs to live, find the common parent component that renders components based on the state and 
decide if it should be lifted up or managed in a separate component.

## Higher-Order Function
1. Higher-order functions are functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them.

2.The second line of this function is defining an anonymous arrow function that takes a parameter m and checks if m is greater than n.

3.map is a higher-order function that transforms each element of an array using a provided function, creating a new array.
