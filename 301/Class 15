# Authentication
## OAuth
1. OAuth is an open standard protocol for secure authorization and delegation of access without sharing credentials.

2. Example: Signing in to an app using your Google account without sharing your password.

3. OAuth steps
User initiates authorization.
Service provider prompts user for authentication.
User grants authorization.
Service provider issues an access token.
Client accesses protected resources.
Access token usage and expiration.

4. OpenID is an authentication protocol used with OAuth for user authentication across multiple websites or services with a single set of credentials.

## What is the difference between authorization and authentication?

1. Authentication: Verifying identity. Authorization: Granting access based on permissions.

2. Authorization Code Flow: Web app flow for obtaining access token and refresh token.

3. Authorization Code Flow with PKCE: Enhanced version with added security using proof key.

4. Implicit Flow with Form Post: Client-side web app flow returning access token in URL fragment.

5. Client Credentials Flow: Flow for confidential clients to obtain access token directly.
Device Authorization Flow: Flow for devices with limited input capabilities.

6. Device Authorization Flow: Flow for devices with limited input capabilities.

7. Resource Owner Password Flow: Flow collecting user credentials for access token exchange.
