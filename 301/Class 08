## APIs
This topic matters because for this module because its important to understand APIs if we are creating them.

1.REST stands for Representational State Transfer
2.REST APIs are designed around a  resources, which are any kind of object, data, 
or service that can be accessed by the client.
3. The identifier of a resource is the URI that uniquely identifies that resource. For example, 
https://adventure-works.com/orders/1
4. The most HTTP verbs are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.
5. The URIs should be based on nouns (the resource) and not verbs (the operations on the resource).
6. https://adventure-works.com/orders
7. Having a chatty web API means that it has a lrge number of small resources and
a client application has to send multiple requests to find all of the data required.
It's a bad thing.
8. The successful status code for GET request is 200
9. The unsuccessful status code for GET is 204.
10. The successful status code for Post is 201.
11. The successful sttus code for DELETE is 204.
