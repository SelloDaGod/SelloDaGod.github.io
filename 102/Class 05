CSS-(Cascading Style Sheet) 
CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users â€” how they are styled, laid out, etc.

There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

External CSS
Internal CSS
Inline CSS

External Style Sheet- You can change the entire look of a website
External styles are defined within the <link>
The internal style is defined inside the <style> element
An inline style may be used to apply a unique style for a single element.
