# JavaScript
JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions.
JavaScript's dynamic capabilities include runtime object construction, variable parameter lists, function variables, dynamic script creation (via eval), object introspection (via for...in and Object utilities), and source-code recovery (JavaScript functions store their source text and can be retrieved through toString()).
Javascript provides tools to make a site interactive.
Examples of what Javascrpit allows you to do.
*Store useful values inside variables. In the above example for instance, we ask for a new name to be entered then store that name in a variable called name.
*Operations on pieces of text (known as "strings" in programming). In the above example we take the string "Player 1: " and join it to the name variable to create the complete text label, e.g. "Player 1: Chris".
*Running code in response to certain events occurring on a web page. We used a click event in our example above to detect when the label is clicked and then run the code that updates the text label.

Prompt- It will show a pop-up window with the text provided as the first parameter and with a textbox the user can fill in.
